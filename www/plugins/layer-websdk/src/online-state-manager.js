/**
 * This class manages a state variable for whether we are online/offline, triggers events
 * when the state changes, and determines when to perform tests to validate our online status.
 *
 * It performs the following tasks:
 *
 * 1. Any time we go more than this.pingFrequency (100 seconds) without any data from the server, flag us as being offline.
 *    Rationale: The websocket manager is calling `getCounter` every 30 seconds; so it would have had to fail to get any response
 *    3 times before we give up.
 * 2. While we are offline, ping the server until we determine we are in fact able to connect to the server
 * 3. Trigger events `connected` and `disconnected` to let the rest of the system know when we are/are not connected.
 *    NOTE: The Websocket manager will use that to reconnect its websocket, and resume its `getCounter` call every 30 seconds.
 *
 * NOTE: Apps that want to be notified of changes to online/offline state should see layer.Client's `online` event.
 *
 * NOTE: One iteration of this class treated navigator.onLine = false as fact.  If onLine is false, then we don't need to test
 * anything.  If its true, then this class verifies it can reach layer's servers.  However, https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=277372 has replicated multiple times in chrome; this bug causes one tab of chrome to have navigator.onLine=false while all other tabs
 * correctly report navigator.onLine=true.  As a result, we can't rely on this value and this class must continue to poll the server while
 * offline and to ignore values from navigator.onLine.  Future Work: Allow non-chrome browsers to use navigator.onLine.
