/**
 * Layer does not at this time have a concept of Users, so this class
 * is more of a convenience/utility than required use.
 *
 * The main conveniences provided by this class are that when
 * used in conjunction with the `client.users`  array,
 * and the `client.addUser(user)` method, each instance
 * will look for/monitor for Conversations that are direct
 * messages between the currently authenticated user and
 * the user represented by this User instance.
 *
 * This is useful if listing users and want to show their last
 * message or their unread message count.
 *
 *      client.addUser(new layer.User({
 *          displayName: 'Fred',
 *          id: 'fred1234',
 *          data: {
 *              a: 'a',
 *              b: 'b',
 *              lastName: 'Huh?'
 *          }
 *      }));
 *
 * The id will be what is used to find matching Conversations.
 *
 * displayName is not required, but is a convenient place
 * to store a displayable name.
 *
 * The data property contains an arbitrary javascript object
 * with any relevant details of your user.
 *
